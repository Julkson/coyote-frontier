# Notes:
# just a little loot n shoot POI. Pretty much the second POI to even exist

# Coyote Notes:
# it's NOT just a little loot and shoot POI.
# in what world do we think free syndicate outposts are a good idea. the non-pirate antag larping must go.
# the syndicate doesn't even have a foothold here like they do in frontier because NT doesn't have solid footing either.
# commented all this shit out. let me know before you revert it because this shit is a headache to deal with. - jaeger / kilmented on gh / jeagurt on discord
