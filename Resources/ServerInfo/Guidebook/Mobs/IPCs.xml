  # I.P.C.

   ### Homeworld
  Cadraenov Epsilon

  ### Temperment
  IPC tend to be Analytical in nature, enjoying jobs and tasks that allow them to flex their curiosity and experiment with the world around them.

  ### Secondary Species of Interest
  Goblin - IPC's and Goblins tend to get along very well.  The nearly ubiquitious desire for learning from IPC mixing very well with the Goblin desire to just try new ideas.

  Slime People - IPC have a slight - and often totally uncalled for - fear of the Slimier members of crew, usually revolving around rumors of short circuting.

  Reptillians - Many IPC find the cold calculating nature that some of their reptillian crewmates to fall well in line with their own often analytical natures.

  An IPC (short for Integrated Positronic Chassis) is a type of sentient robot and is considered an [color=yellow]independent individual[/color], meaning [color=red]they are not guided by any laws of robotics[/color]. IPCs cannot be hacked by Emags because they do not have to follow any predefined directives in their system. [color=red]IPCs are silicon-based beings, so doctors do not have the skills to repair them.[/color]

  Like borgs, IPCs have a positronic brain as their processing source. However, unlike them, IPCs can't be assembled. "It's cheaper to create a shell that obeys you than one that doesn't! *wink*"

  ### Perks
  IPCs have the following perks:
  - They are immune to [color=yellow]toxins[/color], [color=yellow]drugs[/color], and [color=yellow]alcohol[/color].
  - They are also immune to the effects of [color=yellow]space[/color], [color=yellow]low pressure[/color], and [color=yellow]radiation[/color].
  - They do not need to eat, drink, or breathe.
  - They are easy to revive, just repair the damage and hit the "Restart" button in the right-click menu.
  - Their power cell can be swapped out with a self-charging one, to never need to recharge again!
  - They can use [color=yellow]welding tools[/color] to repair brute damage, [color=yellow]cables[/color] to repair burn damage, and [color=yellow]glass sheets[/color] to repair blindness.
  - They have a built-in [color=yellow]headset[/color] and do not need to carry one.

  ### Drawbacks
  IPCs have the following drawbacks:
  - They are vulnerable to [color=yellow]EMP[/color] damage, which will drain your battery.
  - They are slowed by low battery, by up to 90% at 0 charge.
  - They are severely affected by the [color=blue]cold[/color], which will damage them rapidly.
  - They take [color=yellow]double damage from fire, heat, and cold[/color] and can be set on fire more easily.
  - They cannot use chemicals or medicine of any kind to be healed. Welding tools, cables, and glass sheets are their only means of healing!
  - They take [color=yellow]Structural[/color] damage, such as that from pickaxes, drills, and PKAs. However, they resist [color=yellow]50%[/color] of it.

  This means you can survive space wearing nothing but a winter coat, though you'll probably want a suit for the protection.

  ## Recharging an IPC

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="BorgCharger" Caption="Borg Charger"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="PowerCellMedium" Caption="Power Cell"/>
  </Box>
  IPCs can be recharged in three different ways:

  APC Terminal: IPCs can use APC terminals to recharge. Press [color=yellow]Alt + left click[/color] on a terminal as many times as needed to fully recharge.

  Borg Rechargers: IPCs can use borg rechargers to recharge. Always prioritize the ones outside of the Sci area to avoid headaches.

  Power Cell: IPCs have an internal power cell that serves as their battery. They can simply swap it out by opening the hatch and manually replacing it.

  ## Integrated Radio

  </Box>

  IPCs do [bold]not[/bold] use external radios because they already have one built in. They only need to get an encryption key from a radio. By clicking on an IPC with a [color=yellow]wire cutter[/color], you can remove their keys.
  You can find new keys around the station or remove one from a sector radio using a [color=yellow]screwdriver[/color].

  ## Repairing
  <Box HorizontalAlignment="Stretch">
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="WelderIndustrialAdvanced" Caption="Welder"/>
    Welders can be used to repair [color=yellow]Brute[/color] and [color=yellow]Structural[/color] damage.
  </Box>
  <Box HorizontalAlignment="Stretch">
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CableApcStack" Caption="Cables (any type)"/>
    Cables can be used to repair [color=yellow]Burns[/color] and [color=yellow]Structural[/color] damage too.
  </Box>
  <Box HorizontalAlignment="Stretch">
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SheetGlass" Caption="Glass Sheets (any type)"/>
    Glass Sheets can be used to repair [color=yellow]Blindness[/color].
  </Box>
    In the event an IPC dies, after being fully repaired, it should be restarted using the [color=yellow]"Restart"[/color] button (located by right-clicking).

    [color=red]DO NOT DEFIBRILLATE OR SHOCK A DEAD IPC. They'll explode and probably kill you too![/color]
